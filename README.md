This is my learning project int which I implemented a ride-hailing service in Java using the Spring Boot framework. The project includes the following features:

Admin users can register new admins, update the password of existing admins, and delete existing admins.
Customer users can register new customers, delete existing customers, and book trips.
Driver users can register new drivers, delete existing drivers, and update the status of their cab (available or unavailable).
Trips can be booked and the system will assign the nearest available driver and cab to the customer.
Customers can cancel or complete trips.
